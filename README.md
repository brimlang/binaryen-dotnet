Brim.Binaryen provides .NET bindings for the Binaryen toolchain:

* A managed P/Invoke wrapper in the `Brim.Binaryen` namespace
* Prebuilt native `libbinaryen` shared library (per RID)
* The `wasm-opt` executable, for CLI-style optimization

This package is maintained by the Brim project, but is usable in any .NET application that needs Binaryenâ€™s optimization or codegen APIs.

## Getting Started

Install from NuGet:

```sh
dotnet add package Brim.Binaryen
```

Example usage:

```csharp
using Brim.Binaryen;

// Probe the native library once at startup
Brim.Binaryen.Internal.BinaryenLoadGuard.EnsureLoaded();

// Create a simple module and run optimizations
using var m = BinaryenModule.Create();

var options = OptimizeOptions.O2()
    .AddPass("dce")
    .AddPass("inlining-optimizing")
    .Normalize();

m.RunOptimizations(options);

// Serialize back to wasm
var bytes = m.Write();
File.WriteAllBytes("out.wasm", bytes);
```

You can also invoke `wasm-opt` directly from the packageâ€™s `runtimes/<rid>/native` folder if you prefer the CLI.

## Native Library Release Process

To improve CI performance, native shared libraries are built separately and published as GitHub releases:

### Creating Native Library Releases

Native libraries are built via the **Build Native Libraries** workflow (`.github/workflows/native-libraries.yaml`):

1. **Manual trigger**: Go to Actions â†’ "Build Native Libraries" â†’ "Run workflow"
2. **Automatic**: Runs monthly to check for new Binaryen versions  

The workflow:
- Builds native libraries for linux-x64, osx-arm64, osx-x64, and win-x64
- Creates a release tagged as `binaryen-{version}` (e.g., `binaryen-version_123`)
- Includes proper licensing information (LICENSE-BINARYEN, UPSTREAM.txt)
- Only runs if the release doesn't already exist

### How Main CI Uses Prebuilt Libraries

The main CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`) automatically:
1. Downloads prebuilt artifacts from the matching `binaryen-{version}` release
2. Falls back to building natively if no prebuilt release is available
3. Supports all platforms without long build times

This reduces typical CI runs from ~60 minutes to ~5 minutes by reusing prebuilt libraries.

## Developer Quickstart

This repo uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for toolchain management.

**Prequisites:**
  You need to have Clang (or gcc) installed on Linux/macOS, or Visual Studio on Windows.


1. **Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)**
   Follow the instructions for your platform.

   * Linux/macOS:

     ```bash
     curl https://mise.run | sh
     ```

   * Windows (PowerShell):

     ```powershell
     irm get.mise.jdx.dev | iex
     ```

2. **Clone**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brimlang/binaryen-dotnet.git
   cd binaryen-dotnet
   ```

3. **Run the build + tests using mise tasks**

   ```bash
   mise install

   # Initialize submodules, etc.
   mise run setup

   # Build native Binaryen for your platform - alias bn
   mise run build-native

   # Build managed bindings - alias bm
   # Pass -c Release for release build
   mise run build-manage

   # Run unit tests (includes smoke tests of wasm-opt + Binaryen interop)
   mise run test
   ```

4. **Pack the NuGet package (local)**

   ```bash
   mise run pack
   ```

5. Clean Slate

  ```bash
  mise run nuke
  ```


NuGet packages land in `artifacts/package/release/`.
