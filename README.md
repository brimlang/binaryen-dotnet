Brim.Binaryen provides .NET bindings for the Binaryen toolchain:

* A managed P/Invoke wrapper in the `Brim.Binaryen` namespace
* Prebuilt native `libbinaryen` shared library (per RID)
* The `wasm-opt` executable, for CLI-style optimization


This package is maintained by the Brim project, but is usable in any .NET application that needs Binaryenâ€™s optimization or codegen APIs.


## Getting Started

Install from NuGet:

```sh
dotnet add package Brim.Binaryen
```

Example usage:

```csharp
using Brim.Binaryen;

// Probe the native library once at startup
Brim.Binaryen.Internal.BinaryenLoadGuard.EnsureLoaded();

// Create a simple module and run optimizations
using var m = BinaryenModule.Create();

var options = OptimizeOptions.O2()
    .AddPass("dce")
    .AddPass("inlining-optimizing")
    .Normalize();

m.RunOptimizations(options);

// Serialize back to wasm
var bytes = m.Write();
File.WriteAllBytes("out.wasm", bytes);
```

You can also invoke `wasm-opt` directly from the packageâ€™s `runtimes/<rid>/native` folder if you prefer the CLI.

## Native Library Release Process

To improve CI performance, native shared libraries are built separately and published as GitHub releases:

### Creating Native Library Releases

Native libraries are built via the **Build Native Libraries** workflow (`.github/workflows/native-libraries.yaml`):

1. **Manual trigger**: Go to Actions â†’ "Build Native Libraries" â†’ "Run workflow"
2. **Automatic**: Runs monthly to check for new Binaryen versions

The workflow:
- Builds native libraries for linux-x64, osx-arm64, osx-x64, and win-x64
- Creates a release tagged as `binaryen-<nbgv_version>` (e.g., `binaryen-123.0.2`)
- Includes proper licensing information (LICENSE-BINARYEN, UPSTREAM.txt)
- Only runs if the release doesn't already exist

### How Main CI Uses Prebuilt Libraries

The main CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`) **requires** prebuilt native libraries:
1. Downloads prebuilt artifacts from the matching `binaryen-<nbgv_version>` release
2. **Fails with a clear error if any required artifact is missing** (no fallback native build in CI)
3. Supports all platforms without long build times

This reduces typical CI runs from ~60 minutes to ~5 minutes by reusing prebuilt libraries.


## Developer Quickstart

This repo uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for toolchain management (optional, but recommended).

**Prerequisites:**
- .NET 9.0+ SDK
- CMake
- Clang/GCC (Linux/macOS) or Visual Studio (Windows)
- Git with full history (not shallow clone)

**Critical:**
- Always follow the build and test sequence in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Always run native build scripts before managed builds.
- **NEVER CANCEL** native build commands; they may take up to 60 minutes.
- Always specify explicit RID (`-r <rid>`) when running tests locally.
- Do **not** change the .NET target framework unless explicitly asked.
- Always run `dotnet format <project>` before committing changes.

**Setup steps:**

1. **Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)** (optional, for task shortcuts)
2. **Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brimlang/binaryen-dotnet.git
   cd binaryen-dotnet
   ```
3. **Run the build + tests**
   - Using mise tasks (recommended):
     ```bash
     mise install
     mise run setup
     mise run build-native
     mise run build-managed
     mise run test
     ```
   - Or follow the manual sequence in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
4. **Pack the NuGet package (local)**
   ```bash
   mise run pack
   ```
5. **Clean Slate**
   ```bash
   mise run nuke
   ```

NuGet packages land in `artifacts/package/release/`.
